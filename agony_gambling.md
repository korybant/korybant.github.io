# We Are Agony Gambling

We are agony gambling.  

Sometimes one of our thumbs comes  
unglued, and that is how we  
track won hands. A blue tally.  

It's all poker chit skin tags,  
knucklebone dice. Come on down,   
roll 'em, get your organs spliced.  

Our own modular body  
parts are the pot in this game.  

The cards in our hands   
're our own bartered phalanges.  
The take's made of our kidneys.  

Here is a trick. In a loss,  
not all organs can be treated equal.  
Which bit comes off's important.  

If you're not careful  
to keep spare organs, you could end up sprawled  
out limbless where your last bid  

meant a bad transplant. Maybe  
you parted ways with the wrong artery  
and hemorrhaged every drop  

of bluff offa your tongue, and every curve  
of subterfuge off your cornered lips.  
And you'll seem toothless.  

Here's a trick. You should always  
trade away worthless  
parts of yourself for extra  

essentials. You should always  
have some kind of pump at hand  
for circulating blood, some dexterous  

something to grip the next hand with, whether  
a cheliped or squid's lash,  
and an axle or legs to make  

escape from an unfavorable table.  

And don't ever let  
go of your colon: people  
don't know what "lack" is  

until they're full of it and can't lay waste.
